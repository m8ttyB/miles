# The Miles Project
This is simply a repo to hold code for projects my kid and I work on. It will
likely be very low volume since he's fairly young. However, we've begun to work
on a few mixed project - hardware and software - that are reasonably complex
that tend to see a fair amount of delicate tweaking.

### Robot Plant

Adafruit has a wonderful CLUE recipe for building a flower watering bot. this
was a wonderful little weekend project that my 6 year old was able to do the
build on. I did the code tweaks as well as flashing the firmware onto the
[Clue nRF52840 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4500).
